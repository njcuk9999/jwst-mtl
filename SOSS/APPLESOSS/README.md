## Code for the APPLESOSS&trade Empirical Profile Construction Module

The empirical profile construction aka the *APPLESOSS* (A Producer of ProfiLEs for SOSS; Radica et al. in prep) module builds 2D spatial profiles for the first, second, and third diffraction orders for a NIRISS/SOSS
GR700XD/CLEAR observation. The profiles are entirely data driven, only employing models where absolutely necessary and as such retain a high level (hopefully...) of fidelity to the original observations.

These profiles are intended to be used as the specprofile reference file for the *ATOCA* 1D extration algorithm.
